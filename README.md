# Spot Painting Generator
Uses the turtle graphics library to generate spot paintings similar to those made famous by [Damien Hirst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Hirst)

Colors are chosen by sampling prominent colors from an existing image file.

The following parameters can be easily changed to produce different outcomes.

`gap` - The amount of space between each spot  
`radius` - The radius of each circle  
`number_of_rows` - The number of rows of spots  
`spots_per_row` - The number of spots in each row  
`margin` - The amount of whitespace to add surrounding the outside edge  
`image_sample_path` - The path to the image file to sample for colors
